The JAMstack isn’t a specific set of tools, but a new, modern way of building websites & apps. Where does “J-A-M” come from, you may ask? From these three core concepts:

JavaScript: Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client.

APIs: All server-side functions or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTPS with JS. Be it SaaS, third-party services or custom-built.

Markup: Templated markup should be prebuilt at build time, usually using a site generator for content sites, or a build tool for web apps.

Great. But what does it all mean in practice?

For a long time, using a coupled CMS was the norm: it organized development efforts and gave clients the autonomy to manage their site.

But that was 5+ years ago.

Countless developers have since felt the pains of working with CMS.

We became aware that traditional CMSs (WordPress, Drupal) were just trying to do… too much.

We realized how cumbersome they were. How opinionated. These user-friendly admins started feeling less friendly.

Thanks to modern browsers, static site generators, CDNs, and APIs, we’re now seeing web developers transition from dynamic server-side applications to modular, client-side stacks.

JAMstack is a significant shift in focus from the now abstractable backend to the now powerful frontend.

For those new to the concept, here are the best practices defining a JAMstack project:

Entire site/app on a CDN
Atomic deploys
Instant cache invalidation
Everything lives in Git
Automated builds
But it didn’t come to life with just the snap of a finger. Like I said at the beginning, it’s been a few years in the making.
